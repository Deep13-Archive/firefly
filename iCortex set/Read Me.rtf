\f0\fs24 \cf0 These files are intended to replace the icons for iCal.  To install, find iCal in the Finder, right- or control-click on the icon, and click "Show Package Contents".  Open the folder called "Resources" with the window that opens, then find the files "App.icns" and "App-empty.icns".  Rename or move them, then replace them with the two files in the iCortex set.  Be sure you have kept a backup of the original App.icns and App-empty.icns so that you can revert to them if you don't like iCortex.\
